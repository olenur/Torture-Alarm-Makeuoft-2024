# Torture-Alarm-Makeuoft-2024
My teammates and I participated in Makeuoft 2024 and created an alarm app that buzzes and flashes when the user doesn't wake up which consistently gets louder and brighter as well as more frequent over time. It also has upcoming features which we didn't have time to fully implement such as using a boxing glove through a servo motor and also potentially using a water jet to be more effective. We utilized python's new gui, Taipy, to create the user interface. We won the award of Best Use of Taipy.
